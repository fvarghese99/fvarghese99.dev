# Finny's Profile Page

Welcome to my personal profile page repository. This is where I've put together a snapshot of my professional background, my projects, and interests.

## Overview

I built this profile page using a selection of modern web technologies to create a responsive and accessible user experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: Leveraged for its server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities, providing a fast-loading and SEO-friendly foundation.
- **React**: Powers the interactive elements of the site, thanks to its component-based architecture.
- **MDX**: Enables me to write JSX in Markdown documents, which is perfect for weaving React components into my content.
- **Node.js**: Serves as the runtime environment, necessary for running a Next.js app.
- **Yarn**: Manages the project's dependencies to ensure that the application runs smoothly.
- **CSS**: The styling language I used to give the site its unique look and feel.
- **Nextra**: Assists with static site generation in a Next.js environment, especially useful for incorporating themes and enhancing MDX files.
